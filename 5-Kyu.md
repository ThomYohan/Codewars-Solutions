## Sum of Pairs
https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-of-pairs/

Given a list of integers and a single sum value, return the first two values (parse from the left please) in order of appearance that add up to form the sum.

Negative numbers and duplicate numbers can and will appear.

NOTE: There will also be lists tested of lengths upwards of 10,000,000 elements. Be sure your code doesn't time out.

```javascript
function sumPairs(arr, sum){
 var results = {}
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; ++i) {
    if (results[sum - arr[i]]) return [sum - arr[i], arr[i]];
    results[arr[i]] = true
  }
}
```

## Weight for Weight
https://www.codewars.com/kata/weight-for-weight

My friend John and I are members of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)". John is worried because each month a list with the weights of members is published and each month he is the last on the list which means he is the heaviest.

I am the one who establishes the list so I told him: "Don't worry any more, I will modify the order of the list". It was decided to attribute a "weight" to numbers. The weight of a number will be from now on the sum of its digits.

For example 99 will have "weight" 18, 100 will have "weight" 1 so in the list 100 will come before 99. Given a string with the weights of FFC members in normal order can you give this string ordered by "weights" of these numbers?

Example:
"56 65 74 100 99 68 86 180 90" ordered by numbers weights becomes: "100 180 90 56 65 74 68 86 99"

When two numbers have the same "weight", let us class them as if they were strings and not numbers: 100 is before 180 because its "weight" (1) is less than the one of 180 (9) and 180 is before 90 since, having the same "weight" (9) it comes before as a string.

All numbers in the list are positive numbers and the list can be empty.

```javascript
function orderWeight(str) {

  return str.split(' ').sort((a,b) => {
      return strSum(a) === strSum(b) ? a.localeCompare(b) : strSum(a) - strSum(b);
    }).join(" ");
}

function strSum(str) {
  return str.split('').reduce((a,b) => {
    return a + Number(b);
  }, 0);
}
```
## Calculating with Functions
https://www.codewars.com/kata/calculating-with-functions

This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the results. Let's have a look at some examples:

```javascript
seven(times(five())); // must return 35
four(plus(nine())); // must return 13
eight(minus(three())); // must return 5
six(dividedBy(two())); // must return 3
```

Requirements:

There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")
There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, dividedBy (divided_by in Ruby)
Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers
The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand

```javascript
function expression(number, operation){
	if(!operation)
		return number;
	return operation(number);
}

function zero(operation) { return expression(0, operation); }
function one(operation) { return expression(1, operation); }
function two(operation) { return expression(2, operation); }
function three(operation) { return expression(3, operation); }
function four(operation) { return expression(4, operation); }
function five(operation) { return expression(5, operation); }
function six(operation) { return expression(6, operation); }
function seven(operation) { return expression(7, operation); }
function eight(operation) { return expression(8, operation); }
function nine(operation) { return expression(9, operation); }

function plus(x) {
	return function(y) {
		return y + x;
	}
}
function minus(x) {
	return function(y) {
		return y - x;
	}
}
function times(x) {
	return function(y) {
		return y * x;
	}
}
function dividedBy(x) {
	return function(y) {
		return y / x;
	}
}
```
