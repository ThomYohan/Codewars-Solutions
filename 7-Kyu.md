## Easy Wallpaper
https://www.codewars.com/kata/easy-wallpaper

John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He has been said that making sure he has the right amount of wallpaper is more complex than it sounds. He wants a fool-proof method to getting it right.

John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h meters. The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll is 10 meters. He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.

Last time he did these calculations he caught a headache so could you help John? Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.

#Example: wallpaper(4, 3.5, 3) should return "ten"

#Notes:

all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge
0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers), it can happens that w x h x l is zero
the integer r (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20

```javascript
function wallpaper(l,w,h){
	 var numbers = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine', 'ten', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen', 'twenty'];
	return !l || !w || !h ? 'zero' : numbers[Math.ceil(2*h*(l+w)/0.52/10 * 1.15)];
}
```
## Mumbling

This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:

Examples:

accum("abcd");    // "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
accum("RqaEzty"); // "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
accum("cwAt");    // "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z.

```javascript
function accum(str){
	return str.split('').reduce((acc, val, index) => {
		acc.push(Array.apply(null, {length: index+1 }).map((x,i) => !i ? val.toUpperCase() : val.toLowerCase()).join(''))
		return acc
	}, []).join('-')
	
}
```
